= NMEA2000_esp32 library for ESP32 boards =

Inherited object for use NMEA2000 library for ESP32 Boards.
See also https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000[NMEA2000] library.

To use this library, you will also need NMEA2000 library.

The library defines as default Tx pin to GPIO 16 and Rx pint to GPIO 4. You can 
change these with defines:

  #define ESP32_CAN_TX_PIN GPIO_NUM_16
  #define ESP32_CAN_RX_PIN GPIO_NUM_4

before including NMEA2000_CAN.h or NMEA2000_esp32.h

== Thanks ==

Thanks to Thomas Barth, barth-dev.de for his implementation of
ESP32 CAN driver. Instead of using his driver as external driver
I implemented the code to the NMEA2000_esp32 to avoid conflicts.
